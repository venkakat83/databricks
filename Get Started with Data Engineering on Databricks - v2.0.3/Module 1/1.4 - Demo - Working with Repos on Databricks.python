Please note that a PAT is just like a username and password and should be treated with the same security that you would use with a username and password. Also, the PAT you will generate in your own Github account will not give other users, or Databricks' employees, access to your Github account. To generate a PAT in Github:\n1. Click [here](https://github.com/) to navigate to Github. Because you should never trust a link provided by a third-party, please verify that you are now on the official Github site by examining the URL in your browser.\n1. If you are not currently signed in to Github, do so now using your own credentials. Again, if you do not have a Github account, or if you do not wish to use your own account, just follow along.\n1. In the upper-right corner of Github, click the image associated with your account, and select \"Settings.\"\n1. At the bottom of the left navigation bar, click \"Developer Settings.\"\n1. At the bottom of the left navigation bar, click \"Personal access tokens\" and select \"Tokens (classic).\"\n1. In the upper-right corner, click \"Generate new token\" and select \"Generate new token (classic).\"\n1. Give the token a name in the \"Note\" field. I recommend \"Delete Me.\"\n1. Provide an expiration date for the token. I recommend \"7 days.\"\nTo make the connection between Databricks and Github, you will need to select two scopes: repo and workflow.\n1. Tick the boxes next to \"repo\" and \"workflow\" to select them.\n1. Click \"Generate token.\"\nThe token is now listed and is shown. **This is the only time the token will be shown. You must copy it at this time, or you will have to generate a new one.**\n1. Copy the token by clicking the double-square icon. Github will let you know that the token has been copied.","commandVersion":1,"state":"finished","results":null,"resultDbfsStatus":"INLINED_IN_TREE","resultDbfsErrorMessage":null,"errorSummary":null,"errorTraceType":null,"error":null,"workflows":[],"startTime":0,"submitTime":0,"finishTime":0,"collapsed":false,"bindings":{},"inputWidgets":{},"displayType":"table","width":"auto","height":"auto","xColumns":null,"yColumns":null,"pivotColumns":null,"pivotAggregation":null,"useConsistentColors":false,"customPlotOptions":{},"commentThread":[],"commentsVisible":false,"parentHierarchy":[],"diffInserts":[],"diffDeletes":[],"globalVars":{},"latestUser":"a user","latestUserId":null,"commandTitle":"","showCommandTitle":false,"hideCommandCode":false,"hideCommandResult":false,"isLockedInExamMode":false,"iPythonMetadata":null,"metadata":{},"streamStates":{},"datasetPreviewNameToCmdIdMap":{},"tableResultIndex":null,"listResultMetadata":[],"subcommandOptions":null,"contentSha256Hex":null,"nuid":"59e78575-8c0e-4649-a2a2-1f5807583f76"},{"version":"CommandV1","origId":2730474723968007,"guid":"b6ce0169-e682-4210-b01f-3ab2c294b1c5","subtype":"command","commandType":"auto","position":7.0,"command":"%md\n### Add the PAT to Databricks\nPerform the following steps to add the PAT to Databricks:\n1.

Click in the first cell of the notebook. It is called \"Cmd 1\" and has a \"1\" next to it.\n1. Type `%md` and press return/enter to move to the next line.\n1. Type `### This is my first notebook`.\n1. Click in the whitespace below the cell. You should see bold text that says, \"This is my first notebook.\"'\n1.

You can compare your local version to the remote version and commit changes, as needed:\n1. Click the word \"published\" next to the name of the notebook. This opens the repo's comparison window.\nIn this window, you can create branches, change branches, perform a hard reset, and merge. We will not be discussing these features in this course. We can see that there is one changed file, the notebook we just added, and we can see the code in this notebook that changed. Let's commit this to the remote repo on Github.\n1. In the lower-right corner, type \"added a notebook\" in the \"Commit message (required)\" field.\n1.
