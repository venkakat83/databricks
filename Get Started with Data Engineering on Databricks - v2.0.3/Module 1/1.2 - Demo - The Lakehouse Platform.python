The workspace is the way you organize your assets in Databricks. There are four sections: Home, Workspace, Repos, and Trash.\n### Home\nThe \"Home\" section is a shortcut to your user folder. This folder can also be found by clicking Workspace -> Users -> _your-username_. You can add sub-folders by clicking Add -> Folder, or you can create new assets like Queries, Alerts, Notebooks, MLFlow experiments, and others.\n1. Create a new notebook in your home folder\n1. Change the name of the notebook in the upper-left corner of the notebook. \"Name it Getting Started.\"\n1. Go back to your home folder by clicking Workspace -> Home. The notebook appears in your Home folder.\nLet's share the notebook with others.\n1. At the far right of the notebook name, click the kebab menu and select \"Share (Permissions).\" Note that the notebook is shared with you, and the Admins group, by default.\n1. Click in the input box, and select \"All Users.\" On the right, you can select the privileges you are granting to this group. They can view, run, edit, or manage the notebook, depending on which option you choose. Note: whichever option you choose, the group will be granted all privileges below that option (i.e., if they can edit, they can also run and view).\n1. For the privilege type, select \"Can View.\"\n1. Click \"Add.\"\n1. Click the \"X\" to close the sharing dialog box.\nLet's delete the notebook.\n1. Again, click the kebab menu to the far right of the notebook name. Note: there are many options in this menu (Open in new tab, Clone, Rename, etc). We are not going to discuss these in this course.\n1. Select \"Move to Trash.\"\n1. Confirm that you wish to move the notebook to the trash by selecting \"Confirm and move to Trash.\"\nThe notebook is moved to the trash. If you wish to undo this action or permantly delete the item, click \"Trash\" on the left side of the page.\n1. Click the kebab menu to the far right of the notebook name.
